# NLP Assignments

This repository contains various assignments focused on different aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each assignment includes a Python program that demonstrates a specific NLP concept or algorithm. Sample input dataset is given within the each code file.

## Assignments Overview

Assignment_1. **Tokenization and Stemming**
   - Perform tokenization (Whitespace, Punctuation-based, Treebank, Tweet, MWE) using NLTK library. Use porter stemmer and snowball stemmer for stemming. Use any technique for lemmatization.

Assignment_2. **Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF**
   - Perform bag-of-words approach (count occurrence, normalized count occurrence), TF-IDF on data. 

Assignment_3. **Text Cleaning and TF-IDF Representation**
   - Perform text cleaning, perform lemmatization (any method), remove stop words (any method),  label encoding. Create representations using TF-IDF. Save outputs.  

Assignment_4. **Creating a Transformer with PyTorch**
   - Create a transformer from scratch using the Pytorch librar 


## Getting Started

To run these programs, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.x
- `nltk` library
- `sklearn` library
- `genism` library
- `pandas` library
- `PyTorch` library

### Installation

To install the required libraries. It will take some time, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas genism scikit-learn torch
```

### Running

'x' should be replace with the actual number of assignment.

```bash
python Assignment_x.py
```
